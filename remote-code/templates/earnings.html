{% block text_tech %}
<p>In order to compute the average earnings per pattern we obtained the
	skills for each project (29.965), its currency and the amount of money
	that was actually payed to the person who was given the project - the
	accepted bidder. Afterwards, the job pattern was retained as a
	BitVector and each project was analysed and an average for each job
	pattern was computed. All foreign currencies were converted to US
	Dollars.</p>
<p>When working on this section, the first approach was to use the
	average bid on each project. Although at first it might seem like a
	good idea, it turns out that some bidders actually wanted huge amount
	of money for a project (for example, one wanted $500.000 on a project
	with around $3000 budget) probably because of the currency differences
	(he might have confused US Dollars with his own currency).</p>
{% endblock %}

{% block text_main %}
<p>This section presents the average earnings for different job
	types patterns.</p>
<p>
	Let's say a project needs PHP and HTML; in this case its skill patterns
	will be PHP and HTML. The user chooses the desired skills and those
	skills represent a pattern. <b>FreelyStats</b> searches for this
	pattern and shows all the other patterns that contain it, ordered by
	the average amount of money that was earned from it. For example, PHP
	and HTML pattern is included in PHP, HTML and MySQL pattern.
</p>
<p>The top 10 patterns regarding the money that can be earned are
	also displayed at the bottom of the page.</p>
{% endblock %}

{% block text_analysis %}
<p>It can be observed that the average sum payed for some projects is
	very high. For example, if the user chooses only PHP, the first pattern
	is worth $5000. The reason for this high average is that probably there
	is a single project in the analyzed dataset which was a big project
	which was payed very well. Thus we can see that the amount of money
	payed for a project depends not only on the skills, but on the size of
	the project and most likely on the delivery time (the shorter the time
	the higher the price).</p>
